The party for throwing Has snow cones a’glowing With bragging rights out on display. So now you must plan it, To beat the armed bandits who keep all the candy away.

It's the most wonderful time of the year!

Morale has been low at the North Pole this year. But Santa really believes in “making spirits bright!” So he has planned a friendly competition among the elves to keep the Christmas cheer alive and make as many toys as possible! And the winning team gets a snow cone party!

As one of the team leaders, you know that nothing keeps your fellow elves more productive and motivated than a steady supply of candy canes! But all seven levels of the Candy Cane Forest are closed for revegetation, so the only ones available are stuck in the break room vending machines. And even though you receive free snacks on the job, the vending machines are always broken and don’t always give you what you want.

Due to social distancing, only two elves can be in the break room at once. You and another team leader will take turns trying to get candy canes out of the 100 possible vending machines in the room, but each machine is unpredictable in how likely it is to work. You do know, however, that the more often you try to use a machine, the less likely it will give you a candy cane. Plus, you only have time to try 2000 times on the vending machines until you need to get back to the workshop!

If you can collect more candy canes than the other team leaders, you’ll surely be able to help your team win Santa's contest! Try your hand at this multi-armed candy cane challenge!
